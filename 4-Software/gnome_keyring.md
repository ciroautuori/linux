# Arch Linux: Set up GNOME Keyring for Secure Storage

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure **GNOME Keyring** on your **Arch Linux** system for secure management of passwords and SSH keys. The setup involves installing necessary packages, modifying PAM settings, and configuring environment variables.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that:
- You have **Arch Linux** installed.
- You have administrative (sudo) access.
- You are comfortable using a terminal and text editors.

## 1. Install Required Packages

First, install the necessary packages for **GNOME Keyring** and **libsecret** to securely store passwords:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gnome-keyring libsecret
```

---

## 2. Modify PAM Configuration

Next, modify the **PAM** configuration file to ensure that **GNOME Keyring** is loaded on login. Open the **login** file in your preferred text editor (using **nano** here):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/login
```

Scroll to the end of the file and add the following two lines:

```bash
auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so
session optional pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
```

Save the file by pressing `CTRL+O`, then press `ENTER`, and finally exit by pressing `CTRL+X`.

---

## 3. Configure User Environment

Now, we need to configure the user environment. Open (or create) the `.xprofile` file in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.xprofile
```

Add the following lines to the file:

```bash
eval $(/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh)
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

This will start the **GNOME Keyring** daemon for managing your keys and environment.

---

## 4. Verify the Setup

To verify that everything is working correctly, check the environment variables to ensure the keyring daemon is running:

```bash
echo $GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

Both should return paths under `/run/user/1000/`, confirming that **GNOME Keyring** is active.

---

## 5. Restart GNOME Keyring Daemon

If you need to restart the **GNOME Keyring Daemon**, you can kill the existing process and restart it:

```bash
killall gnome-keyring-daemon
gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh
```

This will restart the daemon and ensure that **GNOME Keyring** is running properly.

---

## 6. Install Seahorse for Keyring Management

To manage your keyring and stored passwords, you can install **Seahorse**, a GUI for GNOME Keyring:

```bash
sudo pacman -S seahorse
```

Once installed, you can launch **Seahorse** from your application menu and easily manage your passwords and SSH keys.
